# Description

WS-N client library

We can consider this as a first approach at writing a WS-N (web services notifications -- see [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsn)) push client.

Connects to the WS-N broker, subscribe to one or more topics and get the
notifications through the builtin http server.

# BUGS

Might still be rather specific to the context I've been playing with (ADS-B homegrown client).
